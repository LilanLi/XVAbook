# Derivatives Pricing and Credit Exposure modelling: Python Prototype of XVA for Practitioners (2.0)
It is a practical guide to introduce Derivative pricing and Counterparty Credit Exposure modelling, including XVA. 

XVA has been a hot topic in the industry for the last decade and probably more years to come. It has gathered many powerful brains into these subjects within Quantitative Finance. This book opens up the subject for non-mathematical savvy people. Many simple examples are used to explain concepts like Randomness of asset behavior, Derivatives , Counterparty Credit Risk, Monte Carlo method and most importantly, XVAs. With the help of graphs and Python prototypes, the technical complexity will be lower and the subject much easier to understand.

WHAT IS NEW IN THE SECOND EDITION

Credit Derivatives trading, in particular Correlation products are introduced in this new edition. Desk level risk management including hedging and client facing tactics are also included. Products covered are CDS, CLN and CDO. I covered these during my time at JP Morgan and Barclays Credit Hybrids derivatives Trading & Structuring around 2008-2012. Markets have changed a lot since the financial crisis and most of these products now have a very thin market with a small number of active players. This is the reason why I only touched lightly on products like FTD/NTD and Recovery Swaps, but I wanted to preserve the product knowledge and the memories from my primitive years in banking.

Enjoy the book and its contents and hope you have some fun with the Python as well! Lilan
